OpenGL Notes

* For persistent mapping of buffers, use glMapBufferRange instead of glMapBuffer
* Use multiple buffers for frame latency, but do not use many
	* 3 Buffers
	* One for being read
	* One for next frame
	* One for writing in current frame
	* Less buffers for less input latency
* Use ring buffers for rendering

* glMapBufferRange with coherent and persistent bits
* Use 256 bit alignment for uniform/constant buffers
* Use 512 bit alignment for texture buffers
	* GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER, glTexSubImage2D
